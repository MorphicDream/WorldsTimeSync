# WorldsTimeSync

This is a simple plugin that when a player sleeps in a bed it will move time forward until the morning across all worlds.  It does this by loading any worlds that are unloaded and checks if they are a normal world. that is to say that it isnt a nether or end type world.  Once it has the worlds it sets every time in every world to be morning.  There is a short message telling everyone who slept to move time forward and also a generalised message informing players who slept and if they were in the same world as themselves.

Currently it has only been tested on 1.12.2 spigot servers.
